Problem Statement: Equalizing an Array Using Generators

You are given an array of integers. Your task is to make all elements in the array equal by using two types of generators:

Generator 1: Adds 1 to at most one element in the array during a turn.
Generator 2: Adds 2 to at most one element in the array during a turn.
Objective: Determine the minimum number of turns needed to make all elements in the array equal using these two generators.

Rules:

On each turn, you can choose to use either Generator 1 or Generator 2 or make no changes.
The goal is to reach a state where all elements in the array are equal.
Example 1:
Input: [2, 1, 2, 4]
Steps:

Turn 1: No changes, array remains [2, 1, 2, 4]
Turn 2: Add 2 to the first element, array becomes [4, 1, 2, 4]
Turn 3: Add 1 to the second element, array becomes [4, 2, 2, 4]
Turn 4: Add 2 to the third element, array becomes [4, 4, 2, 4]
Turn 5: No changes, array remains [4, 4, 2, 4]
Turn 6: Add 2 to the third element, array becomes [4, 4, 4, 4]
Output: The number of turns required to equalize the array is 6.


Example 2:
Input: [1, 1, 1, 2]
Steps:

Turn 1: Add 1 to the first element, array becomes [2, 1, 1, 2]
Turn 2: No changes, array remains [2, 1, 1, 2]
Turn 3: Add 1 to the second element, array becomes [2, 2, 1, 2]
Turn 4: No changes, array remains [2, 2, 1, 2]
Turn 5: Add 1 to the third element, array becomes [2, 2, 2, 2]
Output: The number of turns required to equalize the array is 5.


Problem Requirements
Write a function that takes an integer array as input and returns the minimum number of turns needed to equalize the array.
The function should simulate the use of Generator 1 and Generator 2 as described, applying the generators strategically to achieve the goal with the minimum turns.

Input: A list of integers representing the array.
Output: An integer representing the minimum number of turns required.

Example Input/Output
Input: [2, 1, 2, 4]
Output: 6
Input: [1, 1, 1, 2]
Output: 5



Hints:
1. First, identify the largest number in the array, as all elements will eventually need to be increased to this value.
2. Focus on the difference between each element and the maximum element.
3. Prioritize using Generator 2 (adding 2) when possible, and use Generator 1 (adding 1) to fine-tune the values.


Solution - there was arraylist given - i conveted into array, so i could use sort function
