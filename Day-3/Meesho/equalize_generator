To solve this problem, you want to equalize an array by using two generators:

Generator 1: Adds 1 to at most one element in the array.
Generator 2: Adds 2 to at most one element in the array.
The goal is to determine the minimum number of times you need to use these generators to make all the elements in the array equal.

Case-2
[1,1,1,2]
output-
