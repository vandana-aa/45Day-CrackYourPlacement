Given throws of dice =[1, 2,1,2,1,2] and k=2.
output- 6*6*5 =150

Dice is thrown k times times what are the different possible values.
1<=i<=6
Each number in the array represents how many times the dice can land on that number.




Case 2: k=3
[2, 3, 2, 10, 2, 5] 
o/p- 6*6*6 -3 
Removing the case of (1,1,1), (3,3,3) and (5,5,5)
ans- 216-3= 213
Output - 213

Case 3:
[5,1,1,1,1,1] k=2
Ans- 6* 6 -2
Output= 34
